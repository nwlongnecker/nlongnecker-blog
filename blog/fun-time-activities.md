# Fun Time Activities
_Last updated November 4, 2024_

Team building is an important element of a high-performing team. Part of team building is having some time to interact outside of work conversations to get to know your coworkers better. In an office environment these types of conversations usually happen naturally, but in a hybrid or fully remote work environment it can be helpful to schedule dedicated time to interact without talking about work. Below is a list of activities I've used for team building on past teams.
