# Finance
_Last updated April 2, 2023_

This page and subpages are dedicated to various financial questions that a few of my friends have asked me about. I'm always happy to share what I know!

**Disclaimer**: Finance, retirement savings, and minimizing one's tax burden is a very complex area. There are many nuances and exceptions to the general statements in these documents. My goal is not to provide a comprehensive guide (there are plenty of guides out there that already do that for specific topics), but rather to frame the problem space and provide a good enough overview to for folks who are unfamiliar with the space to feel confident enough to start asking the right questions and do their own research.

In these documents, I attempt to distill the main concepts to make it easy to understand. To simplify things, all tax numbers and contribution limits I use as examples are for single filers, since picking one to use consistently helps to simplify things document.

* [Tax Advantaged Accounts](./tax-advantaged-accounts.md)
* [Investing](./investing.md)

Resources:
* [Personal Finance Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/): I frequently browse this reddit community to see what types of finance questions are most frequently asked and seeing what resources responders share. The wiki is a great starting point for anyone looking to get started thinking about their finances.
* [White Coat Investor](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/): This site is geared towards doctors, but most of the information here is applicable to anyone in a high-paying job so I've found it to be a great resource.
