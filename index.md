* **[Glue](https://noidea.dog/glue)**: This article illustrates a real problem in tech: that some of our most capable engineers (frequently women) get pushed out of tech because they see and do the essential work to keep the team running, but it is percieved as not promotable work. The article is worth reading in full because it also includes some fantastic insights, for example:
  * Getting promoted as a woman or minority **is** diversity work.
  * Capable engineers who spend a lot of their time doing glue work may need to stop doing that glue work, even though it is likely the most impactful work, so they can focus on growing skills necessary to advance their career.
