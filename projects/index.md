# Personal Projects
_Last updated April 8, 2023_

This page describes some personal projects I've done over the years. These projects have varying levels of completion, but showcase some of the things I've explored outside of work.

## Health Screening App

A couple friends and I created this simple health screening web form for a startup in 2020. The startup never got going, but the form is still hosted for free on netlify!

## Board Game - Iron Dragon

Iron Dragon is one of my favorite board games. It has relatively simple mechanics but a good amount of strategic depth, and involves drawing on the board with crayons! When the pandemic happened in 2020, a friend and I couldn't find a suitable place to play it online, so we decided to try to implement our own version. We also decided to explore what we could achieve without frameworks, just vanilla JavaScript and HTML5. We never completed it, but the goal was more about exploring and learning than delivering a completed product.

## Unity Game - "Escape"

This one was a high school project. I haven't updated it since 2011, so no guarantees it'll run, but it was a fun project learning how to use the unity game engine. It's a 3D puzzle game modeled after Myst or Portal.
